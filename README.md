These are images provided by [yaroph](https://forum.cfx.re/u/yaroph) in his [post](https://forum.cfx.re/t/drawn-inventory-icons-qbcore-oxcore/5214605), of which the ox related images are already shipped with `ox_inventory`. We however also want the QB related images which are shipped with `qb-inventory`. Thank you to Yaroph for providing these images for free. If you need additional images you can always support him and get his paid packages. You can even use creator code `ox10` while you're are at it to support the Overextended team.
